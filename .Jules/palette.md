## 2024-05-15 - Enhancing Simulation Controls and State Visibility
**Learning:** In highly visual apps like simulations, displaying interactive control shortcuts directly in the main HUD is critical for discoverability. Additionally, distinct states like "Paused" vs "Running" need strong visual differentiation (e.g., full-screen overlays rather than just text labels) to be instantly recognizable without reading, improving cognitive load and accessibility. Pure text labels on visually chaotic backgrounds also suffer from contrast issues unless explicitly placed on a dark, semi-transparent backdrop.
**Action:** When working on complex visualization or simulation interfaces, always ensure state changes (like pausing) have high-contrast, full-screen visual cues, guarantee text contrast with semi-transparent backdrops, and surface essential keyboard shortcuts persistently in the UI.
